    <p>Here you can find my projects and learn more about me.</p>

    <h3>My life :</h3>
    <h4>2009 : I'm born</h4> 
    <p>This is where it all started</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>2022 : I installed Linux</h4>
    <p>I was only 12 years old when I decided to take this life changing decision. The first distro I installed was Ubuntu, and only three months after that, I decided to install Arch Linux, so that I could officially say "I use Arch btw !"</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>2023: I started web development</h4>
    <p>It was in 2023 that I bought my first domain name (<a href="https://gougoule.ch">gougoule.ch</a>) and discovered HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>2023-present: I've never stop building new apps.</h4>
    <p>Since then, I have been working on various projects, most of them in JS, and more recently in Go too !</p>

    <h3>My projects :</h3>
    <h4>Gougoule.ch</h4>
    <p>This is my personal website, where I showcase my projects. It was initially a search engine that worked by scraping results from DuckDuckGo.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Gougoule AI Frontend</h4>
    <p>This is yet another LLM frontend. The name is really temporary and I have some big plans for this...</p>
    <hr>
    <h4><a href="https://leksik.ch">Leksik</a></h4>
    <p>This is the only project I'm making in collaboration with other people. It's a website to help students learn words when learning a new language and it has many AI features in it.</p>
